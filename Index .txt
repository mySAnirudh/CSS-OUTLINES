 Outlines are very similar to borders, but there are few major differences as well: 
 An outline does not take up space.
 Outlines do not have to be rectangular.
 Outline is always the same on all sides; you cannot specify different 
values for different sides of an element.
NOTE: The outline properties are not supported by IE 6 or Netscape 7.
You can set the following outline properties using CSS.
 The outline-width property is used to set the width of the outline.
 The outline-style property is used to set the line style for the outline.
 The outline-color property is used to set the color of the outline.
 The outline property is used to set all the above three properties in a 
single statement.
